</dependency>
```

## Connectors
Spark can connect with almost any datasource, followings are configurable connectors readily available.
More connectors can be added similarly, existing can also be modified as per requirements. Refer to [ConnectorProperties.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/config/properties/ConnectorProperties.java) for connector configurations.
```yaml
ksoot:
  connector:
    save-mode: Append
    output-mode: Update
```
**Description**
* `ksoot.connector.save-mode`:- To specify the expected behavior of saving a DataFrame to a data source, with Default value as `Append`. Applicable in Spark **Batch** jobs only. Allowed values: `Append`, `Overwrite`, `ErrorIfExists`, `Ignore`.
* `ksoot.connector.output-mode`:- Describes what data will be written to a streaming sink when there is new data available in a streaming Dataset, with Default value as `Append`. Applicable in Spark **Streaming** jobs only. Allowed values: `Append`, `Complete`, `Update`.

#### File Connector
To read and write to files of various formats in batch and streaming mode. Refer to [FileConnector.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/connector/FileConnector.java) for details.
It can be customized with the following configurations as follows. Refer to [FileOptions.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/config/properties/FileOptions.java) for details on available configuration options.
```yaml
ksoot:
  connector:
    file-options:
      format: csv
      header: true
      path: spark-space/output
      merge: true
```
Spark can read and write files to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA9667BhDoARIsANnamQa61fwU5NCXspECJZ52q4cOnWuGY7aJWKyKK9KaBNpGTecv49HJ0PYaAigJEALw_wcB&trk=b8b87cd7-09b8-4229-a529-91943319b8f5&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA9667BhDoARIsANnamQa61fwU5NCXspECJZ52q4cOnWuGY7aJWKyKK9KaBNpGTecv49HJ0PYaAigJEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536324516040!e!!g!!aws%20s3!11539706604!115473954714) and [Google GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage) as well.  
Depending upon the file scheme, the following configurations are required.
* If a file path starts with `s3a://`, Spark would know the file is to be read from or written to AWS S3 and look for following configurations.
```yaml
spark:
  hadoop:
    fs:
      s3a:
        access.key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY:<put your aws access key>}
        secret.key: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY:<put your aws secret key>}
        endpoint: ${AWS_S3_ENDPOINT:<put your aws s3 endpoint>}
        impl: org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem
        path.style.access: true  # For path-style access, useful in some S3-compatible services
        connection.ssl.enabled: true  # Enable SSL
        fast.upload: true  # Enable faster uploads
    google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile: ${GCS_KEY_FILE:<put your sa-key.json>}
```
* If a file path starts with `gs://`, Spark would know the file is to be read from or written to Google GCS and look for following configurations.
```yaml
spark:
  hadoop:
    google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile: ${GCS_KEY_FILE:<put your sa-key.json>}
```
* If you want to read from or write to a local file system, so no additional configurations are required.
* If you want to read from or write to different AWS S3 or Google GCS accounts in same Job, you can provide above configurations as `options` to `SparkSesson` at runtime as follows.  
```java
this.sparkSession
    .read()
    .option("fs. s3a. access. key", "<put your aws access key>")
    .option("fs. s3a. secret. key", "<put your aws secret key>")
    .option("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint", "<put your aws s3 endpoint>")
```

```

#### JDBC Connector

Expects to be provided with basic database connection configurations along with few customization parameters as follows. Refer to [JdbcOptions.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/config/properties/JdbcOptions.java) for details on available configuration options.

      url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432
      database: error_logs_db

Expects to be provided with basic kafka connection configurations along with few customization parameters as follows. Refer to [KafkaOptions.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/config/properties/KafkaOptions.java) for details on available configuration options.

  connector:
    kafka-options:
    bootstrap-servers: ${KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS:localhost:9092}
    topic: ${KAFKA_ERROR_LOGS_TOPIC:error-logs}
    fail-on-data-loss: ${KAFKA_FAIL_ON_DATA_LOSS:false}
```

## Job Listener
An auto-configured Job listener with the following features. Refer to [SparkExecutionManager.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/SparkExecutionManager.java) for details.
- Log Job startup and completed on timestamps, time taken by Job.
- Sets status as `Completed` for successful completion, `Failed` for failed Jobs and `Terminated` if stopped prematurely as per Job stop request.
- Set an exit message as Job status.
- Log errors as per thrown exception in case of Job exit with failures.
- Listens to kafka topic `job-stop-requests` to terminate a running job.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> On Job stop request arrival, it just tries to stop `SparkContext`, but it is not guaranteed method to stop the running job.
> Sometimes the kafka listener may face thread starvation issue, as the available threads could be overwhelmed by Spark job and listener may never get a chance to execute.
> Or even after calling stop method on `SparkContext`, the job may not stop immediately. 
> To force-stop the job you may need to find a mechanism to kill the job. Kill from **Spark UI** or [**`spark-submit.sh --kill 20160615124014699000`**](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ias?topic=spark-canceling-running-application#d141740e99).

## Spark Stream Launcher
An auto-configured Launch Spark streams with following features. Refer to [SparkStreamLauncher.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/SparkStreamLauncher.java) for details.
- Start and await on Spark stream in a separate thread, so that multiple streams can be started without blocking the main thread.
- Optional, Retry mechanism to restart the stream in case of failure.

## Exceptions
It is discouraged to create a lot of custom exceptions. Only one custom exception class [JobProblem.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/error/JobProblem.java) can be used to throw exceptions as follows.

```java
try {
    // Some file reading code
} catch (final IOException e) {
  throw JobProblem.of("IOException while listing file by reading from aws").cause(e).build();
}
```

[JobProblem.java](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/error/JobProblem.java) provides a fluent builder pattern to build its instance.
* Create an exception with hardcoded message. Optionally can set a cause exception and runtime arguments to inject into message placeholders.
```java
JobProblem.of("Error while reading file: {}").cause(fileNotFoundException).args("/home/data/input.csv").build();
```
* Recommended to create Enums as follows to define error codes and messages.
```java
public enum PipelineErrors implements ErrorType {
  SPARK_STREAMING_EXCEPTION(
      "spark.streaming.exception", "Pipeline Exception", "Spark Streaming exception"),
  INVALID_CONFIGURATION(
      "invalid.configuration",
      "Configuration Error",
      "Invalid conguration value: {}, allowed values are: {}");

  // Skipping constructor and other methods
}
```
This way the error title and message can be customized in `messages.properties` or any other configured resource bundle as follows.  
Note in following message keys, `title` and `message` prefix to error codes mentioned in above enum.
```text
title.spark.streaming.exception=My custom title
message.spark.streaming.exception=My custom message, check param: {0}, {1}ception=My custom title
title.invalid.configuration=Some title
message.invalid.configuration=Some message
```

## Utilites
#### [SparkUtils](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/util/SparkUtils.java) 
* Convert column names to Spark Column objects.
* Check if a dataset contains specific columns.
* Wrap column names with backticks if they contain slashes.
* Log the schema and content of a dataset, see method `public static void logDataset(final String datasetName, final Dataset<Row> dataset, final int numRows)`.

#### [SparkOptions](src/main/java/com/ksoot/spark/common/util/SparkOptions.java)

* Executor: Contains constants for Spark executor options.
* Column: Defines constants for column-related options.
* Common: Includes common options like header, schema inference, path, and format.
